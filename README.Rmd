This is a method to support the prioritizartion of bus lanes.

This script helps to identify the road network segments with higher bus frequency, to support planning of BUS lanes.

It uses GTFS data for a given city or region, *overlines* the routes with they hourly frequency, and compares them with existing bus lanes and/or streets with more than 1 lane per direction.

We use mainly two R packages:

-   [**`GTFShift`**](https://u-shift.github.io/GTFShift/) to download and manipulate GTFS data
-   [**`stplanr`**](https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr) to manipulate the bus routes
